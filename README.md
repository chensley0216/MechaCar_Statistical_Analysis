## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
For deliverable one, we used linear regression to determine coefficients and quartiles for columns in the data frame.  Based on the data provided, the non-random variance in mpg for the variables are as follows:
vehicle_length    2.60e-12
vehicle_weight    0.0776
spoiler_angle     0.3069    
ground_clearance  5.21e-08
AWD               0.1852 

Because the p-value, 5.35e-11, is greater than 0.05, the slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero.  
With an r-squared value of 0.71, this shows that there is a 71% chance of accuracy in the mpg predictions in this model.
